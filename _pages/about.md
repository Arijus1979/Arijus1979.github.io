My name is Arijus Tama≈°auskas and I'm from Vilnius, Lithuania. 

I'm currently a third-year Information Systems Engineering major at Vilnius University. Presently, I'm broadening my academic and cultural horizons by participating in an exchange program at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea. 

This experience is a fantastic opportunity for me to delve deeper into my field while experiencing a new culture.
